# üå± Zyra

**Zyra** is a version control system built from scratch in Python.  
The name *Zyra* is short, snappy, and inspired by plants. In *League of Legends*, Zyra is a plant-themed champion. Since Git also uses tree structures (objects, roots, branches), this felt like an acceptable analogy for me.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Zyra Works

At its core, Zyra follows the same architecture as Git.

1. Everything is stored in **objects**.
2. There are **four types of objects**:
   - **Blob** ‚Üí Stores file contents.  
   - **Tree** ‚Üí Represents the entire working directory (contains items - leaves).  
     - Reference: `common/tree/tree_obj.py`  
   - **Commit** ‚Üí Represents a snapshot (tree's sha, parent‚Äôs sha, commit message, etc.).  
   - **Tag** ‚Üí Human-readable tags for objects.  
3. An **index file** is used for staging.  
   - Reference: `/stage`

## üì¶ Storage Model

Zyra (like Git) stores data by compressing and hashing objects.

Example: storing a file `one.txt` with contents `"Hi there"`:

1. Compute size: `len("Hi there") = 8`.
2. Wrap in a **blob object**.
3. Compress with **zlib**.
4. Format:  b'{object_type}{size}\x00{content}'

Example: b'blob8 Hi there'

5. Compute the **SHA hash** of contents.
6. Store in:

   ```
   .git/objects/<sha[0:2]>/<sha[2:]>
   ```

## üöÄ Installation

### Using Docker

If you‚Äôve cloned the repo and have Docker:

```bash
# Build the dockerfile
docker build --no-cache -t zyra .

# Run interactively with volume mounted to your current path
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/app zyra
```

Or with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up run zyracli
```

### Without Docker

If you don‚Äôt have Docker, you can create an executable directly:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
chmod +x zyra.py
alias zyra=./zyra.py
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure you‚Äôre in the same directory to run commands.
> Usage: `zyra <subcommand>`

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
mkdir example
cd example
touch ex1.txt ex2.txt

zyra init
zyra add ex1.txt ex2.txt
zyra status
zyra commit -m "first commit"
```

üéâ Congratulations! You just created your first commit with Zyra.

---

## ‚ö° Complex example
```bash
mkdir example
cd example
touch ex1.txt ex2.txt
(add some txt)
zyra init
zyra add ex1.txt
zyra commit -m "master commit"
zyra all-commits
zyra create-branch dev
zyra switch dev
zyra add ex2.txt
zyra commit -m "dev commit"
zyra all-commits
zyra b-commits (branch specific commits)
(Change the text of ex2.txt)
zyra add ex2.txt
zyra commit -m "dev second commit"
zyra b-commits
zyra switch master
```

## ‚ö° Challenges Faced

1. Writing the **staging area** logic.
2. Understanding Git‚Äôs branching model (solved by using `.git/branches` alongside `/refs/heads`).
3. Managing **file metadata**, which is verbose (much of it unused).
4. Converting the **index file ‚Üí tree SHA** was tricky.

---

## üå≥ Why Git?

Git was referenced often because Zyra follows the same architecture, so understanding Git internals was crucial to implementing Zyra.
